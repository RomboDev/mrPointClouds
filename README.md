While this is for the now defunct mentalray renderer it could be of some interest because it sports fully featured octree implementation with and without SSE support together with various traversals, REYES splatting, multithreaded (windows) code, global illumination point rasterizer (micro rasterizer), diffusion SSS and ambient occlusion and heavy use of C++ templates. It's tested for compilation with ICC on Windows.
